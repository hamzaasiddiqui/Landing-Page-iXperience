            <p class="para1">
                I am an undergrad at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute,
                 one of Pakistan's most prestigious educational
                 institutions. I am majoring in BSc in Computer Engineering.
                 I have always been fond of computers and tech which is why
                 I chose to become a computer engineer. I believe that
                 working on hands-on projects can be more educational than
                 studying books and notes, so I applied for iXperience.

                I love to play soccer, badminton, and squash; although I
                 sometimes don’t find the time to do sports, I still work out.
                 I also love to read; starting from fiction, I am currently
                 reading a lot of self-help books. Apart from this, during
                 my free time, I also work as a network head, responsible
                 for dealing with internet complaints on my university
                 campus, as I am part of a student society that manages
                 the campus’ network.
